usage: ./cmpfind.rb dir [find-opt]... -- dir [find-opt]...

the program will start the gnu find tool in both directories,
and print the filesize (for files only) and the filename into 
temporary files.

the it tries to start a diff program to show the difference
of the two directoy trees.

simple, eh?
